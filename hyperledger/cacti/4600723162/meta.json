By default, secrets is not\npossible to be accessed by a pull request from a fork repository\nunless it is merged to the main repository. Hence, the original\npull_request will work after merging.\n\nThe test tokens used in testing were all deleted to prevent further\nusage of it.\n\nSigned-off-by: ruzell22 <ruzell.vince.aquino@accenture.com>\nSigned-off-by: Peter Somogyvari <peter.somogyvari@accenture.com>",
