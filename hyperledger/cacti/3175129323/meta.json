    "message": "feat(connector-iroha2): add support for Iroha V2\n- Add new Iroha V2 cactus connector.\n- Two OpenAPI endpoints are implemented: `transact` and `query`. Both endpoints support\n  critical subset of instructions and queries supported by the upstream javascript iroha sdk.\n- One SocketIO endpoint can be used to monitor new blocks from the ledger.\n- New connector can be used through a verifier-client interface.\n- All added functions are tested in functional test suites and documented.\n- Added execution of Iroha2 tests to the CI.\n\nAdditional notes:\n- Connector doesn't work well with cactus module system, the issue has been reported and described\n  in README. PR is not merge-ready until this is fixed (the CI should fail now).\n- Iroha V2 javascript packages are not available on official npm yet, had to include `.npmrc` with\n  private npm address. I'm not sure if there's ETA of delivering these through NPM, so it might be\n  necessary to commit it after all.\n\nCloses #2138\nDepends on #2140\n\nSigned-off-by: Michal Bajer <michal.bajer@fujitsu.com>",
