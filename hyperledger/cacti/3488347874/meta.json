Refactor validators to use these common instead of own implementation.\n- Remove ValidatorAuthentication.ts that is not used anymore\n  (not part of public interface, it was copied by validators during before couple commits ago).\n- Updated readme with instructions of how to start asset-trade and electricity-trade samples\n  without docker-compose (to be used during development).\n  Added helper script for patching the config.\n- Remove dependency on Indy SDK for the main build\n  (it's needed only for running dockerless discounted-cartrade sample now)\n- Update legacy-socketio-connector Dockerfiles to work after updates.\n\nSigned-off-by: Michal Bajer <michal.bajer@fujitsu.com>",
