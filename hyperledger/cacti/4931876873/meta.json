    "message": "fix(vscode/devcontainer): unexpected exit stdout /etc/passwd\n\n1. Moved away from trying to handroll an Ubuntu-22.04 image for the dev container\nand instead used the \"features\" feature (no pun intended) of the dev container\nspec: https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2022/09/15/dev-container-features\n2. This produces a container that builds and launches reliably without the\nissues the previous version was suffering from (which was that to some people\nthe container would just exit randomly during the launch)\n3. Our future goal of having the dev container being built in a reproducible\nway is still not achieved, but we've gotten closer because in the meantime\nwhile working on this issue it was discovered that we can re-build the images\ndirectly from the CLI by using the dev container CLI package:\nhttps://github.com/devcontainers/cli\n4. The upside of not building the image from scratch is that we can count on\nfuture improvements/maintenance from others who are working on these images.\n5. The downside of not building the image from scratch is that if we end up\nfinding something that does not work due to the customizations, it might be\nmore difficult to figure that out compared to if we had just build our own.\n6. It is hard to predcit right now whether 4) or 5) will end up being having\nthe stronger effect, but we can cross that bridge when we get to it.\n7. In the meantime I've started working on a contribution to the dev container\nCLI itself for a dockerfile ejection feature (meaning that we'll be able to\nrender a single Dockerfile for the dev container (that right now the CLI only\nstores/uses internally in it's own code at runtime). This eject feature will\nbe good for debugging purposes in case anything goes wrong with the image in the\nfuture.\n\nFixes #2404\n\nSigned-off-by: Peter Somogyvari <peter.somogyvari@accenture.com>",
