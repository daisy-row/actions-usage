    "message": "feat(connector-iroha2): add support for Iroha V2\n\n- Add new Iroha V2 cactus connector.\n- Add endpoints `transact` and `query`. Both endpoints support\n  critical subset of instructions and queries supported by the upstream javascript iroha sdk.\n  Transaction can be awaited or can return immediately.\n- Add new endpoint `generate-transaction`, to create unsigned transactions\n  that can be signed on the client side.\n- Add a function to iroha2-connector package to help signing iroha transactions\n  on the client (BLP) side.\n- One SocketIO endpoint can be used to monitor new blocks from the ledger.\n- Add new helper method for signing query payload on the client side.\n- New connector can be used through a verifier-client interface.\n- All added functions are tested in functional test suites and documented.\n- Add test for complex scenario that involves creating new account and asset, and then transfering\n  assets between two accounts.\n- Add test for parsing retrieved block data to find specific transaction hashes.\n- Added execution of Iroha2 tests to the CI.\n\nAdditional notes:\n- Iroha V2 javascript packages are not available on official npm yet, had to include `.npmrc` with\n  private npm address. I'm not sure if there's ETA of delivering these through NPM, so it might be\n  necessary to commit it after all.\n\nCloses #2138\nDepends on #2140\n\nSigned-off-by: Michal Bajer <michal.bajer@fujitsu.com>",
