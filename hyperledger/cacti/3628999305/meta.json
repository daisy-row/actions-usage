    "message": "feat(connector-fabric): add WatchBlocks endpoint\n\n- Add new endpoint for monitoring new blocks. Response type is determined from input argument.\n  Monitor endpoints are stored in connector.runningWatchBlocksMonitors.\n- Add `FabricApiClient` which supports new socketio endpoint.\n- Add functional test to check the new endpoint.\n- Upgrade fabric-sdk-node to solve test hand issue.\n- Loose up `ISocketApiClient` to allow interface monitor options.\n- Update readme with WatchBlocks usage.\n\nRegarding fabric-sdk-node upgrade: with sdk2.3, the test used to hang occasionally.\nI've ensured that all resources are being cleaned-up, and investigated the problem. The issue was\ninfinite recurse dns resolution (of fabric peer address) in grpc-js `ResolvingLoadBalancer`.\nCould not find exact cause of this strange behaviour, the code there is pretty complex\nand didn't want to dig to deep, but I've noticed that recently there were some fixes\nin the functions I suspected so I've updated the fabric-sdk, which uses newer grpc-js,\nand the problem went away, so I assume this was in fact bug in gprc-js. Run this test on repeat for\nhours and didn't notice any error.\n\nCloses: #2118\n\nSigned-off-by: Michal Bajer <michal.bajer@fujitsu.com>",
